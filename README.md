# simple-webserver-demo

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model
2. Make an app that listens on port 8080 and just prints what a client sends then check what a client(browser) is requesting
3. Make a request on a normal server e-spres-oh.com
4. Replicate in our application. Voilla. We should have a webserver that supports get method for any URI
5. Process each request in threads
6. Check what is being requested
7. Add support for more languages


P.S: Code is supposed to be trashy for academic purposes...
